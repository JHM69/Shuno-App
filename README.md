## Summary
We're building the ultimate audio listening app, Shuno (শুনো), which means "Listen" in English. As music lovers and Spotify enthusiasts, we envisioned an even better platform. Shuno combines Music, Podcasts, Audiobooks, Poem Recitations, and Audio Comics in one place. After months of hard work and dedication, our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is ready!

With Shuno, users can enjoy Music, Podcasts, Poems, and other audio content on their phones. We've designed an incredibly cool UI and UX that we believe users will love. Additionally, we've built a Content Management Website where artists can add, update, and manage their content.
